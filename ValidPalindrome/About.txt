1. Find the longest Palindrome:

Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome.

Example 1:
Input: "aba"
Output: True
Example 2:
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.


2. Find the closest Palindrome:

Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.

The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:

Input: n = "123"
Output: "121"
Example 2:

Input: n = "1"
Output: "0"
Explanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.

3. Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
